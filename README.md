# From Data to Decisions: Understanding the Housing Prices determinants in Massachusetts

This study, “From Data to Decisions: Understanding the Housing Prices Determinants,” examines the impact of various factors on housing prices in Massachusetts using linear regression models. I analyzed house features (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, house size, lot size), location, median household income, population density, and crime index. My findings indicate that larger house sizes, more bathrooms, and higher population densities are associated with increased prices, while additional bedrooms and higher crime rates correlate with price declines. Regional disparities reveal that the Central, Northeast, and Southeast regions have notably higher prices compared to the Western region. Median household income is also a significant predictor. This research underscores the diverse factors influencing housing markets and demonstrates strong predictive power with a high R-squared value. 

## Research Question
What is the influence of variables such as house features (# of bed, #of bathroom, house size, lot size), location (Region), median household income, density of population and crime index in determining housing prices using regression models?

## Hypothesis
Hypothesis #1: Larger houses is associated with higher housing prices linked to price perception, utility, prestige and status.

Hypothesis #2: The location of the house and its social and economic relationships are significantly correlated with its price.

## Conclusions
Key Factors: - House size, bedrooms, bathrooms, region, population density, household income, and crime index are significant predictors of house prices.

Impact on Price: - House size: Each unit increase raises the price by $111.60. - Bedrooms: Each additional bedroom decreases the price by $9,635. - Bathrooms: Each additional bathroom increases the price by $61,600. - Region: Central, Northeast, and Southeast regions have significantly higher prices compared to the Western region. - Population Density: Price increases by $16.25 for every unit increase in population density. - Household Income: Price increases by $2.63 for every unit increase in household income. - Crime Index: Price decreases by $12.93 for every unit increase in the crime index.

Significance: All variables have highly significant effects on price.

Model Performance: The model explains approximately 65.85% of the variability in house prices (R-squared = 0.6585).

The analysis shows a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing housing prices. The model indicates that several key variables significantly impact housing prices. Notably, larger house sizes, increased bathroom numbers, and higher population densities correlate with higher prices, while additional bedrooms and a higher crime index lead to price decreases. However, regional differences play a relevant role, with the Central, Northeast, and Southeast regions exhibiting notably higher prices compared to the reference region (Western). Household income also is as a significant predictor affecting housing prices. These findings show how diverse factors impact the housing markets, from property characteristics to socioeconomic indicators. The model’s strong explanatory power, as reflected by its high R-squared value, underscores its utility in understanding and predicting housing price variations in Massachusetts.
